This is a special relativistic location tool for use in relativistic positioning systems. It contains a collection of algorithms for computing the intersection points of future pointing light cones from at least four distinct spacelike separated emission points.

To get started, refer to the tutorials in the [documentation](https://justincfeng.github.io/cereal.jl).
