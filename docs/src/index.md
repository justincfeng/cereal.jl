## Introduction

Relativistic positioning refers to the concept of establishing spacetime
positions from proper time broadcasts emitted by a system of satellites.
Central to relativistic positioning is the relativistic location
location problem, which is the problem of finding the intersection of
future pointing light cones from a collection of at least four emission
points. `cereal.jl` contains a collection of functions for the
relativistic location problem in flat spacetime. 

## Short tutorial

To run the cereal code, one begins by generating a set of emission
points with the following:

    ( X , Xtar ) = cereal.ceval.pgen(Float64,5)

The quantity `Xtar` is a four component vector representing the true
intersection point, and `X` is a ``4Ã—5`` matrix consisting set of `4`
column vectors representing the coordinates of the emission points. The
emission points are constructed by finding points on the past light cone
of the target point `Xtar`.

Three different methods for finding the intersection point have been implemented, which are represented by the strings `CFM10`, `FHC21` and `RTC21`. The method `RTC21` (see reference below) is recommended, but requires at least five emission points. The location function is defined by the following:

    locator = cereal.locatorfunc(5,"RTC21")
